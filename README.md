# pmx-skills

PM workflows, commands, and reusable skills for Gemini CLI.

Inspired by the ideas behind `pm-skills`, this package reimagines product-management workflows as a portable skill system with a Gemini CLI adapter.

🇰🇷 Korean version: [README_KO.md](./README_KO.md)

---

## What this is

`pmx-skills` is a **Product Management workflow package for Gemini CLI**.

Instead of writing one-off prompts every time, you can run structured commands like:

```bash
/pmx:discover
/pmx:prd
/pmx:launch
```

Each command is designed to pull together one or more PM skills so Gemini produces more structured, decision-oriented output.

This package is meant to help with:
- discovery
- research
- strategy
- prioritization
- planning
- delivery
- go-to-market
- growth
- metrics

---

## Why this exists

Most AI usage for PM work starts with blank-page prompting.

That usually creates three problems:
1. outputs are inconsistent
2. important PM steps get skipped
3. good thinking is hard to repeat across projects

`pmx-skills` exists to make PM work more reusable.

It gives you:
- reusable PM skills
- repeatable command workflows
- more explicit assumptions and trade-offs
- outputs that are easier to review and act on

---

## How it works

The package has two layers.

### 1) Commands
Commands are the user-facing entry points under the `/pmx:*` namespace.

Examples:
- `/pmx:discover`
- `/pmx:prd`
- `/pmx:prioritize`

Commands are useful when you want a workflow, not just a generic answer.

### 2) Skills
Skills are reusable PM capabilities under `skills/pmx-*`.

Examples:
- `pmx-discovery`
- `pmx-opportunity-solution-tree`
- `pmx-write-prd`
- `pmx-prioritize-features`

Commands can suggest or bias Gemini toward the right skills for the task.
